    Eric Patrick Clapton CBE (born 30 March 1945) is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter.
He is regarded as one of the most successful and influential guitarists in rock music.[2]
Clapton ranked second in Rolling Stone's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"[3]
and fourth in Gibson's "Top 50 Guitarists of All Time".[4]
He was also named number five in Time magazine's list of "The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players" in 2009.[5]

    Born in Ripley, Clapton taught himself guitar as a teenager, having been influenced by blues performers.
After playing in a number of different local bands, Clapton joined the Yardbirds in 1963, replacing founding guitarist Top Topham.
Dissatisfied with the change of the Yardbirds sound from blues rock to a more radio-friendly pop rock sound,
Clapton left in 1965 to play with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. On leaving Mayall in 1966, after one album,
he formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce, in which Clapton played sustained blues
improvisations and "arty, blues-based psychedelic pop".[6] After Cream broke up in November 1968, he formed the blues
rock band Blind Faith with Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech, recording one album and performing on one tour before they broke up.
Clapton embarked on a solo career in 1970.

Alongside his solo career, he also performed with Delaney & Bonnie and Derek and the Dominos,
with whom he recorded "Layla", one of his signature songs. He continued to record a number of successful solo albums
and songs over the next several decades, including a 1974 cover of Bob Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff"
(which helped reggae reach a mass market),[7] the country-infused Slowhand album (1977) and the pop rock of 1986's August.
Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton's grief was expressed in the song "Tears in Heaven",
which appeared on his Unplugged album, and in 1996 he had another top-40 hit with the R&B crossover "Change the World".
In 1998, he released the Grammy award-winning "My Father's Eyes". Since 1999, he has recorded a number of traditional
blues and blues rock albums and hosted the periodic Crossroads Guitar Festival. His most recent studio album is Happy Xmas (2018).
