    Alongside his solo career, he also performed with Delaney & Bonnie and Derek and the Dominos,
with whom he recorded "Layla", one of his signature songs. He continued to record a number of successful solo albums
and songs over the next several decades, including a 1974 cover of Bob Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff"
(which helped reggae reach a mass market),[7] the country-infused Slowhand album (1977) and the pop rock of 1986's August.
Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton's grief was expressed in the song "Tears in Heaven",
which appeared on his Unplugged album, and in 1996 he had another top-40 hit with the R&B crossover "Change the World".
In 1998, he released the Grammy award-winning "My Father's Eyes". Since 1999, he has recorded a number of traditional
blues and blues rock albums and hosted the periodic Crossroads Guitar Festival. His most recent studio album is Happy Xmas (2018).
